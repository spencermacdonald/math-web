          <p className= "paragraph">What is a Mersenne Prime? Well a mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form:</p>
          <img src={equation} alt="M = 2^n -1"/>
          <p className= "paragraph">Where n is an integer that makes the RHS equation equal to the prime number on the LHS.
            These primes were named after french mathmatician Marin Mersenne, who spent his life researching them.

                run in parrallel to both find and verify new Mersenne primes. This is done through running a <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/download/">custom 
                software</a> developed by the project. This is similar to projects like <a href="https://foldingathome.org/">folding at home</a>, which uses a software

                Sieve of Eratosthenes is an simple algorithm that when done, will generate a list of all the primes of a desired range. The general algorithm is to make a list of numbers from 2 to n, then take the first 
                element not crossed out, add it to the list of primes, then cross out all multiples of the element. The algorithm then selects the new first non-crossed out element and repeats until it reaches the sqrt(n) element.

                We studied primes over the entirety of the course. From the knowledge gained from class, we know that a prime number 'p' is prime if gcd(p,a) for any integer 1 &lt; a &lt; p.

               When a mersenne prime is converted to base 2, it is simply a string of 1's with length 'p', which is given from the equation. This can also be calculated by using a rearranged formula from above, which is:

                127 is a mersenne prime. <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/report_exponent/?exp_lo=7">Proof</a>
              </p>
              <p>p = log<sub>2</sub>(127 +1) = log<sub>2</sub>(128) = 7</p>
              <p>So the binary representation of (127)<sub>10</sub> is (1111111)<sub>2</sub></p>
